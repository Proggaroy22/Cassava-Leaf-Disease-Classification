**Data Augmentation:**

**Augmentation techniques in the training set:**

Resize

Random horizontal flips

Random Rotations

ColorJitter (brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2)

Normalization based on ImageNet mean and std

**Augmentation techniques for validation/test set:**

Only includes resizing, tensor conversion, and normalization.

No augmentation to ensure consistent evaluation.

Split Ratio:   Train: Test: Validation: 70:15:15

**Class distribution in training set:**

Class 4: 2061 samples

Class 3: 10526 samples

Class 1: 1751 samples

Class 2: 1909 samples
